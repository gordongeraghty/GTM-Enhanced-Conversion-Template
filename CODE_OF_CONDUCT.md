# Code of conduct

Be respectful. That's the short version.

## The longer version

**Do:**
- Be helpful to newcomers
- Accept feedback gracefully
- Disagree constructively
- Focus on the work, not the person

**Don't:**
- Harass or insult people
- Make discriminatory comments
- Share others' private information
- Derail discussions

## If there's a problem

Report it to the project maintainers. We'll look into it and take appropriate action.

Repeated violations will result in being removed from the project.
